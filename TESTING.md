### **1. User Stories Testing**  

As a shopper I want to be able to:

1. Rapidly discern the type of products or services offered by the site. 
   The company logo is prominently displayed at the top-center of the homepage, effectively highlighting our brand. The company name is clear and descriptive, immediately conveying the nature of our products. Additionally, the hero image prominently features shoes, clearly indicating our primary product line. As users scroll down the homepage, they will encounter intuitive navigation facilitated by large, visually appealing images of our products.

2. Instantly notice any special deals or promotions.
   As users navigate down the homepage, they will encounter the Final Sale section. Clicking on the 'Shop Now' button will redirect them to a product page where all items on sale are conveniently pre-filtered for easy browsing.
