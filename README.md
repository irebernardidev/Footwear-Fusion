<br/>  

### **C. Structure Plane**  
The website features a Hierarchical Tree Structure, meticulously organized to facilitate easy and intuitive navigation for users. Illustrated below is the website's workflow, thoughtfully crafted using [Creately](https://creately.com/).  

![The website's structure](readme-testing-files/readme/structure.png "The website's structure")   
The design distinctly differentiates the access levels between unregistered and registered users. While unregistered users have the capability to purchase products and receive confirmation emails, they lack certain privileges exclusive to registered users, including:

- Accessing their order history
- Posting, editing, and deleting product reviews
- Creating a personalized list of favorite products.

All the aforementioned functionalities are accessible only to users with a registered account.

[Back to top &uarr;](#non-functional-requirements)  
<br/>  

### **D. Skeleton Plane**  
Using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), wireframes were developed to outline the website's navigation and interface. These wireframes, specifically designed for desktop viewing, form the foundation upon which the interface will be adapted for various device sizes.

ðŸ‘‰ [View Footwear Fusion Wireframes here](readme-testing-files/readme/wireframes "The color scheme")
<br/>

#### **Color Scheme**  
The website's design language is articulated through a color palette that captures the essence of tranquility and natural beauty. Each hue is carefully chosen to create an ambiance that is both calming and welcoming, with a subtle infusion of warmth that conjures a sense of peace and serenity.
At the heart of the palette featured on [Coolors](https://coolors.co), is a gentle cream tone (#F7EDE2), emanating a soft and welcoming aura. Complementing this, a delicate blush pink (#F5CAC3) is selectively employed in minor sections for subtle accents, adding a nuanced layer to the overall aesthetic. Alongside, an effervescent coral (#F28482) injects the layout with a lively yet cozy warmth, resonating with a cheerful and dynamic spirit. Grounding these effusive tones, the muted teal (#84A59D) lends an earthy depth to the aesthetic, echoing the brand's connection to natural elements and understated elegance.

The selection of these colors transcends mere visual pleasure; it is a deliberate strategy to elicit a psychological sense of ease and contentment among visitors. This chromatic harmony is woven consistently throughout the websiteâ€™s interface, from the tactile feedback of interactive elements to the enchanting allure of the hero image. Each detail is steeped in these colors, crafting a cohesive and engaging digital narrative that guides the user through an effortlessly integrated visual experience.
![The color scheme](readme-testing-files/readme/color-scheme.png "The color scheme")

#### **Typography**  
The typographic elements of the website are curated from the extensive collection available at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).   
- Primary Typeface: Noto Sans
  Serving as the primary typeface, Noto Sans is a sans-serif font favored for its contemporary and sleek aesthetic. It is employed across the board for paragraphs and button labels, offering a crisp and uncluttered look.
- Accent Typeface: DM Serif Display
  For a striking contrast, DM Serif Display is utilized for header texts on the Home page. As a serif font, it provides an elegant counterpoint to the sans-serif body text, adding a touch of sophistication and visual interest.

#### **Design Changes on The Final Product**  
The original wireframes were foundational in shaping the final design, however, adjustments were made to ensure optimal functionality and aesthetics:

- The logo underwent a transformation to a bolder version for enhanced visibility, addressing the issue that the initial, finer logo was not as prominent on smaller screens.
- Additional refinements included alterations in button colors and image selections, which were part of the creative evolution during the development process.

## **Database Design**    

The database structure was conceptualized and outlined using [drawsql](https://drawsql.app/), starting with SQLite for the development phase and transitioning to Postgres for the production environment on Heroku. 
![The database schema](readme-testing-files/readme/database-schema.png " The database schema")  

- **Category Model**   
   - This model holds the category names for products, such as Women, Men, and Kids.
   - It includes a 'name' field for database identification and a 'friendly_name' field for the user interface display.

- **Subcategory Model**
   - This captures the subcategory names for products, which range from Sandals to New Arrivals.
   - The Category and Subcategory models are designed to be independent; no direct relationship is established to allow for greater flexibility.
   - Similar to the Category model, it has 'name' and 'friendly_name' fields for database and display purposes, respectively.  

- **Product Model**  
   - This model is a repository of comprehensive product details.
   - It is linked to the Category and Subcategory models through foreign keys.
   - Includes fields such as 'sku' for product identification, 'name', 'has_sizes' as a boolean to indicate if size variations exist, 'price', and 'rating'. 
   - The 'rating' initially reflects a retailer-provided quality assessment, which is updated as users review the product.
   - 'image' field for product visuals, and 'total_purchased' to track sales volume.

- **User Model**  
   - Integral to the Django authentication system, this model stores user credentials, including username, email, and password. [django.contrib.auth](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/contrib/auth/).

- **Order Model**
   - This model documents all the data related to successful orders.
   - It encompasses numerous fields from 'order_number' to 'stripe_pid', detailing everything from the buyer's information to payment details.

- **OrderLineItem Model**
   - Details of individual product orders are stored here.
   - It includes a 'product_size', 'quantity', and 'lineitem_total', which is the product of quantity and price.

- **UserProfile Model**
   - For registered users, this model holds shipping and contact information.
   - It is linked to the User model and contains fields like 'default_phone_number', 'default_country', etc.

- **Review Model**  
   - Captures user reviews for products they've purchased.
   - Includes a 'rating', 'review_text', and 'date' among other fields.

- **Blog Model**  
   - Used for storing blog articles for the website.
   - Contains fields for 'image', 'author', 'title', 'paragraph1', 'paragraph2', 'paragraph3', and 'created_on'.

- **Favorites Model**  
   - Keeps track of a user's favorite products.
   - To handle the many-to-many relationship with products, an intermediary model called 'FavoritesItem' is used, aligning with best practices from the Django documentation. ([source from django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ManyToManyField.through_fields)).

- **Topic Model**
  - This model manages topics for the contact form.
  - It has a 'subject' field for database entries and a 'text' field for the display on the contact form.

- **ContactForm Model**
  - Stores submissions from the contact form.
  - Includes 'name', 'email', 'topic' (linked to the Topic model), 'order_number', 'message', and 'date' fields.

Each model is crafted to not only store essential data but also to create a seamless interaction between different segments of the site, ensuring data integrity and user experience are maintained at the highest standard.

## **Features**  
### **A. General Design Features**  
- **Responsive Design:** The website adapts seamlessly to all devices, ensuring a consistent user experience from the smallest smartphone (minimum width 320px) to the largest desktop display. Navigation is made effortless with intuitive buttons, accessible at any point during the user's journey through the site. 

- **Navigation Bar Across All Pages:**

   ![The Navbar on desktop](readme-testing-files/readme/navbar-desktop.png "The Navbar on desktop") 

   - A distinct favicon, representing the essence of the website, appears at the top of the browser tab, enhancing brand recognition and reinforcing the website's nature.

   ![The Favicon](readme-testing-files/readme/favicon.jpg "The Navbar on desktop") 

   - The Navbar is designed for flexibility, transforming into a hamburger menu on smaller screens for ease of use, and remains fixed at the top of the screen (sticky) for convenient navigation regardless of the user's position on the page.
   - Symmetrically centered at the top, the logo acts as a beacon, always ready to guide users back to the homepage.
   - The search box is strategically placed on the left within the Navbar to facilitate quick keyword searches from the outset.
   - Sign In/Register buttons are prominently located at the top-right corner for unregistered users, unfolding options for either action. This area transforms into a My Account dropdown upon logging in, offering direct links to the user's profile and log-out function.
   - Quick-access links to Favorites and Shopping Bag are embedded within the Navbar, ensuring they're always within reach, no matter where users find themselves on the site.
   - Navigation links are provided for all product categories and subcategories: All Products, Women, Men, Kids, Accessories, and Sale.
   - A persistent sales banner positioned just below the Navbar alerts users to free delivery options, visible on every page for constant visibility.

- **Footer Accessible on All Pages:** 

   ![The Footer on desktop](readme-testing-files/readme/footer-desktop.png "The Footer on desktop") 
   The Footer mirrors the Navbar's color scheme for design continuity and houses all navigational links, social media connections (which open in a new tab), and the central logo that circles back to the Home page when clicked. 

- **Toast Notifications:**   
Toast notifications serve as an interactive feedback mechanism for users, confirming the success or alerting to the failure of their actions. These notifications are color-coded for clarity: red signifies errors, blue for informational alerts, yellow for warnings, and green indicates successful actions. Typically, users will encounter the green success toasts most frequently, such as when adding items to the shopping bag, complemented by a visual cue of the bag itself. For other successful actions like adding items to the favorites list, a success toast appears sans the bag icon. Here are examples of the success toast notifications, with and without the bag icon display.   

![Success toast message - without bag display](readme-testing-files/readme/toast-success-nobag.png "Success toast message - without bag display")
![Success toast message - with bag display](readme-testing-files/readme/toast-success.png "Success toast message - with bag display")   

- **Error Pages:**
Custom error pages for 403 (Forbidden), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error) have been implemented to enhance user experience during encounters with these errors. These pages provide clear information about the error and offer straightforward navigation options to return to the homepage, ensuring users remain informed and can easily continue their browsing.

- Prominently placed beneath the breadcrumb is a 'Final Sale' banner, catering to users' propensity to browse sale items initially. The 'shop now' button on this banner filters the view to showcase only items on sale.
- An exclusive desktop feature, the Side Navigation, allows for swift perusal of categories and subcategories, filtering the display to the user's specific interests. On mobile devices, this functionality is available via the hamburger menu.

The following example illustrates this feature when I'm logged in as the user "ire_b":

![Edit and Delete Review buttons](readme-testing-files/readme/review-edit-delete-button.png "Edit and Delete Review buttons")   
Upon selecting the Edit button, users are redirected to the Edit Review page ðŸ‘‰ [View Edit Review Page](https://github.com/dissyulina/footwear#11-add-edit-review-page).

#### **6. Checkout Page**  
ðŸ‘‰ [View the Checkout Page here](readme-testing-files/readme/checkout-page.png)  
The Checkout page is designed for efficiency and ease, consisting of a form for processing transactions and displaying order details. The form is intuitively organized into three distinct sections for simplicity: 'Details' for the user's name and email, 'Delivery' for the address, and 'Payment' for card information. A summary of products selected on the Bag page, along with the total amount due, is also prominently featured. To facilitate a smooth transaction, call-to-action (CTA) buttons are strategically placed to prompt payment and finalize the purchase or to provide an option to modify the bag contents.

#### **7. Checkout Success Page**   
ðŸ‘‰ [View the Checkout Sucess Page here](readme-testing-files/readme/checkout-success-page.png)

Upon successful transaction processing, the Checkout Success page presents a detailed summary of the completed order. Here, users can review their order specifics, including the list of items purchased, the delivery address, and the billing details. Additionally, as part of this process, users will receive an email confirmation at their registered email address confirming their order.

- Below the form, users will find a 'Submit Review' button to finalize their input. Additionally, a 'Cancel' button is conveniently placed, allowing users to return to the review section of their profile if they decide not to proceed.
- Upon successful submission, the user is redirected back to the review section of their profile. This action is deliberately designed to encourage an ongoing engagement with reviewing additional products.
- It's important to note that while the Add Review and Edit Review pages operate with separate templates, their design and layout remain identical for user familiarity and ease of use.

ðŸ‘‰ [View the Product Management Page here](readme-testing-files/readme/add-product-page.png)  
- Exclusive to Admins or Superusers, the Product Management interface is accessible via the 'My Account' section in the Navbar post-login.
- The interface includes a comprehensive form enabling the addition of new products, with fields for category, subcategory, SKU, product name, size availability, price, rating, and product image.
- An 'Add Product' button at the bottom-center of the page submits the new entry, while a 'Cancel' button provides an easy navigation route back to the products overview page.

#### **18. Edit Product page (Admin / Superuser only)**  
ðŸ‘‰ [View the Edit Product Page here](readme-testing-files/readme/edit-product-page.png)  
- The Edit Product interface is similarly exclusive to Admins or Superusers and is accessed via an 'Edit' link next to each product listing on the Products page, or on Individual Product page.
- Mirroring the Add Product page in design, this consistency ensures a user-friendly experience with a negligible learning curve for administrators.
- Product updates are confirmed with an 'Update Product' button, and a 'Cancel' button is also provided to revert back to the main product listing without making changes.

#### **19. Delete Product Functionality (Admin / Superuser only)**  
- Only Admin or Superuser roles have access to the Delete Product feature. This option can be utilized by selecting the Edit link, which is present for each item on the Products page, or on the Individual Product page, provided the user is logged in as an admin.
- Upon selecting the Delete option, a confirmation modal will appear, asking the admin for final verification before the product is removed.

### **Features to be implemented in the future**
Currently, due to constraints such as limited time, the current skill level of the developer, and other factors, certain features were not implemented in this phase. However, there is significant potential for enhancing this e-commerce website in the forthcoming development phase by incorporating additional features and functionalities. The following are key enhancements envisaged for the web app:
1. Diversifying Payment Options:
Presently, the website supports only card payments due to time limitations. In the next phase, it is planned to broaden the payment spectrum to include options like bank account debits, PayPal, Apple Pay, etc. This expansion will make the platform more akin to a comprehensive online shopping experience.
2. Integrating Social Media Sign-ins:
   Allowing users to register via their social media accounts can streamline the sign-up process and is a preferred method for many. This feature not only simplifies registration but also provides valuable demographic and psychographic data, aiding in better segmentation, targeted website design, and product offerings.
3. Implementing Stock Management:
Currently, the product model lacks a stock field, assuming external logistic management. Adding stock management functionality, where product availability is tracked and displayed, would be a significant improvement. Alert systems for low stock and automatic removal of out-of-stock items from the website are planned for implementation.
4. Introducing 'Load More Products' Functionality:
To enhance user experience, it is proposed to initially load a limited number of products, with the option for users to view more by clicking a 'Load More' button. This would expedite initial page loading. While attempts were made to introduce this feature using AJAX, challenges with integrating filters and other functionalities led to its postponement to the next development phase.


## **Testing**
I have performed thorough testing of the website to ensure its functionality and compatibility with various browsers and devices. Additionally, I have conducted user research and conducted usability tests to identify areas for improvement and optimize the user experience.
The complete documentation of these tests is available for review ðŸ‘‰ [here](TESTING.md).


## **Issues and Bugs**   
### **Resolved Issues**   
During the website development process, I encountered a variety of challenges and bugs. Below, I've detailed some of the more complex issues I faced, along with the effective solutions I applied to resolve them.
1. **Issue**: For every registered user, on their profile page, there's a review section. This review section lists all products that the user has bought before, and are waiting to be reviewed. Once the user gives a review of a product, the product will disappear from this section.
Therefore, for this section, I wanted to display only the products that are in the user's order history, and are not listed in the reviews database. This problem was rather complicated because you have to check in multiple tables, and the process is not straightforward.

**Solution**:
Based on my understanding, this is what came to my mind. In ```views.py```:

```
profile = get_object_or_404(UserProfile, user=request.user)
reviews = Review.objects.filter(user=profile) 
orders = profile.orders.all()
```
And in the template:

```
{% for order in orders %}
   {% for item in order.lineitems.all %}
      {% if item.product.id not in reviews %}
         <!-- Display the products here -->
         ...
      {% endif %}
   {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
```

The above solution didn't work. After a few hours of googling and implementing, I found this topic on Stack Overflow and learned about ```values_list()```.

I then read the Django documentation about ```values_list```, which returns a QuerySet that returns single values (if using ```flat=True```). Using this method, I changed the reviews variable in views.py to:

```
reviews = Review.objects.filter(user=profile).values_list('product__id', flat=True)
```
So that the reviews variable will just return a list of ```product_id``` values.

2. **Issue**: One major bug I ran into was being unable to import the blogs module in Django shell using ```import footwear_fusion.blogs```. This kept failing with a ModuleNotFoundError.
After a lot of debugging, I discovered I could directly import blogs without the full parent app path and access the models like:

```
from blogs import models
print(models)
```

This allowed me to workaround the issue. I added a comment in the codebase noting the odd blog import behavior and to just directly import blogs.
To restore the lost blog data, I reloaded my blog post fixtures by running:

```
heroku run python manage.py loaddata blogs.json
```


After redeploying to Heroku, I confirmed the blogs now display correctly on my live site.
Through methodical troubleshooting, I isolated the problem to just importing this one submodule, found usable workarounds, and got critical blog functionality restored.

3. **Issue**: Stripe webhook handler bug:

The issue was that after a Stripe API update, the payment intent object no longer had a ```charges``` attribute directly available. So my existing code to get billing details and order total was broken.
To fix this, I imported the Stripe library and updated my ```payment_intent_succeeded``` method to:

- Get the latest charge ID from the payment intent:


```
stripe_charge = stripe.Charge.retrieve(intent.latest_charge)`
```
- Extract billing details from the Charge object:

```
billing_details = stripe_charge.billing_details
```
- And the order total from the Charge amount:

```
grand_total = round(stripe_charge.amount / 100, 2)
```


By handling the updated Stripe objects, I was able to get the order information and keep webhook processing working after the API changes.
The key was checking the updated Stripe documentation and adjusting my usage accordingly. Methodical debugging and research helped resolve the integration issue.

## **Deployment**  
The project was developed using Visual Studio Code as the IDE, committed to Git as a local repository, and pushed/stored to GitHub. The web application is deployed on Heroku because we can't host a Python project on Github pages, with static and media files stored in AWS S3. The repository itself is hosted on Github. 

### **A. How To Use This Project**
To use and further develop this project you can either fork or clone the repository.  

#### **Fork GitHub Repository**  
By forking the GitHub repository you can make a copy of the original repository on your GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository, by using the following steps:   

1. Log in to GitHub.  
2. Navigate to the main page of the GitHub Repository that you want to fork.  
3. At the top right of the Repository just below your profile picture, locate the "Fork" Button.  
4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.  
5. Changes made to the forked repository can be merged with the original repository via a pull request.  

#### **Clone Github Repository**  
By cloning a GitHub Repository you can create a local copy on your computer of the remote repository. The developer who clones a repository can synchronize their copy of the codebase with any updates made by fellow developers with push or pull request. Cloning is done by using the following steps:  

1. Log in to GitHub.  
2. Navigate to the main page of the GitHub Repository that you want to clone.  
3. Above the list of files, click the dropdown called "Code".  
4. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "HTTPS", copy the link.  
5. Open Git Bash.  
6. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.  
7. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 4.  
```$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY```
8. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.   
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```  
Changes made on the local machine (cloned repository) can be pushed to the upstream repository directly if you have a write access for the repository. Otherwise, the changes made in the cloned repository are first pushed to the forked repository, and then a pull request is created.  
Click [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) to retrieve pictures for some of the buttons and more detailed explanations of the above process.  

#### **Project Set Up After Forking or Cloning**   
1. Install all dependencies by typing in the CLI ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```  
2. Create a ```.gitignore``` file and ```env.py``` file in the project's root directory. Add the ```env.py``` file to ```.gitignore```. 
3. Inside the env.py file, enter the project's environment variables:   
   ```
   import os
   os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", <your_secret_key>)
   os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", '1')
   os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", <your_key>)
   os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", <your_key>)
   os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", <your_key>)
   ```   
   You can get the keys from:
   - "SECRET_KEY" can be generated using [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/)   
   - "STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY" and "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY" can be generated by creating a stripe account. The keys are found in 'Developers' Section, under 'API Keys'.  
   - In the Developer Section, under 'Webhooks', add a new endpoint.  "STRIPE_WH_SECRET". On Endpoint URL, enter:  
   ``` https://<your_host_url>/checkout/wh/ ```   
   Select to listen to all events, and create endpoint, and you can view your "STRIPE_WH_SECRET".   

4. Make migrations to setup the inital database operations.  
   ``` 
   python3 manage.py makemigrations 
   python3 manage.py migrate 
   ```   
5. Load all datas for the database.  
   ```
   python3 manage.py loaddata categories
   python3 manage.py loaddata subcategories
   python3 manage.py loaddata products
   python3 manage.py loaddata topics
   python3 manage.py loaddata blogs
   ``` 
6. Create a super user.
   ```
   python3 manage.py create superuser
   ```  
The project should now complete to run and can now be used for development. To run the project, type in the CLI terminal: ```python3 manage.py runserver```     

<br/>  

### **B. Deployment to Heroku**  
This project is deployed on Heroku for production, with all static and media files stored on AWS S3. These are steps to deploy on Heroku:

1. Navigate to Heroku.com, create a new account or login if you already have an account. On the dashboard page, click "Create New App" button. Give the app a name, the name must be unique with hypens between words. Set the region closest to you, and click "Create App".   
2. On the resources tab, provision a new Heroku Postgres database.  
3. Configure variables on Heroku by navigating to Settings, and click on Reveal Config Vars. You may not have all the values yet. Add the others as you progress through the steps.   
   Varables | Key   
   ---| ---   
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | your_access_key_id_from_AWS   
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | your_secret_access_key_from_AWS  
   DATABASE_URL | your_database_url   
   EMAIL_HOST_PASS | your_app_password_from_your_email   
   EMAIL_HOST_USER | your_email_address  
   SECRET_KEY | your_secret_key 
   STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | your_stripe_public_key  
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | your_stripe_secret_key  
   USE_AWS | True 
   DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC | 1   

4. If you haven't install it, install dj_database_url and psycopg2.
   ```
   pip3 install dj_database_url
   pip3 install psycopg2-binary
   ```
Note: you don't have to do this if you've installed all dependencies in the requirements.txt file.  

5. Set up a new database for the site by going to the project's settings.py and importing dj_database_url. Comment out the database's default configuration, and replace the default database with a call to dj_database_url.parse and pass it the database URL from Heroku (you can get it from your config variables in your app setting tab)
   ```
   DATABASES = {
     'default': dj_database_url.parse('YOUR_DATABASE_URL_FROM_HEROKU')
   }
   ```
6. Run migrations
   ```
   python3 manage.py migrate
   ```  
7. Import all products, topics (for contact form), and blogs data. I'm using fixtures json files, use therefore the loaddata method.  
   ```
   python3 manage.py loaddata categories
   python3 manage.py loaddata subcategories
   python3 manage.py loaddata products
   ```
8. Set up a new superuser, fill out the username, email address, and password.
   ```
   python3 manage.py create superuser
   ```  
9. Remove the database config from Heroku and uncomment the original config. Add a conditional statement to define that when the app is running on Heroku. we connect to Postgres, and otherwise, we connect to Sqlite.   
   ```
   if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
      DATABASES = {
         'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
      }
   else:
      DATABASES = {
         'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
         }
      }
   ```  
10. Install gunicorn (if you haven't) which will act as the webserver, and put it on the requirements.txt.  
   ``` 
   pip3 install gunicorn
   pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
  ```
Note: you don't have to do this if you've installed all dependencies in the requirements.txt file. 

11. Create a Procfile, to tell Heroku to create a web dyno, which will run unicorn and serve the Django app.   
   ```
   touch Procfile
   ```   

   Inside the Procfile:
   ```
   web: gunicorn Footwear_Fusion.wsgi:application
   ```
12. Login to Heroku through CLI, using ```heroku login```. Once logged in, disable the collect static temporarily, so that Heroku won't try to collect static files when it deploys.
   ```
   heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app footwear-fusion
   ```
   And add the hostname of the Heroku app to allowed hosts in the project's settings.py, and also add localhost so that VS Code will still work as well: 
   ```
   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['footwear-fusion.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
   ```   
13. Add, commit, and push to GitHub and then to Heroku. After pushing to GitHub as usual, initialize git remote first:
   ```
   heroku git:remote -a footwear-fusion
   ``` 
   Then push to Heroku:
   ```
   git push heroku main
   ```
14. Go to the app's dashboard on Heroku and go to Deploy. Connect the app to Github by clicking Github and search for the repository. Click connect. Also enable the automatic deploy by clicking Enable Automatic Deploys, so that everytime we push to github, the code will automatically be deployed to Heroku as well.  
15. Generate a key from [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/) and add it to the convig variables in Heroku. Go back to settings.py and replace the secret key setting with the call to get it from the environment, and use empty string as a default. 
   ```
   SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')
   ```
   Set debug to be true only if there's a variable called development in the environment.
   ```
   DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ
   ```

<br/>  

### **C. AWS Bucket Creation**   
All static and media files in this project are stored in [Amazon Web Services S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/) which is a cloud based storage service. You can create your own bucket by following these steps:   
1. Go to [Amazon Web Service website](https://aws.amazon.com/) and click on Create An AWS Account, or login if you already have an account.  
2. Login to your new account, go to AWS Management Console and find service S3. Click on Create Bucket.   
   - Give it a name (I recommend naming your bucket to match the Heroku app name), and choose region closest to you.  
   - In Object Ownership section, choose ACLS enabled. and Bucket Owner Preffered.   
   - Uncheck box 'Block All Public Access'.  
   - Check box 'I acknowledge that the current settings might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public.'  
   - Click on Create Bucket, and your bucket is created.  
3. Click on your newly created bucket, and navigate to the Properties tab. Scroll down to the bottom until you find Static Website Hosting. Click on Edit, then enable. 
   - Hosting type: choose Host a Static Website   
   - Index document: index.html  
   - Error document: error.html
   - Click on Save Changes.  
4. Navigate to the Permissions tab. Scroll down to the bottom until you find Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). Click on Edit, and paste in this Cors Configuration below, which is going to set up the required access between the Heroku app and this S3 bucket. Click on Save Changes. 
   ```
   [
      {
         "AllowedHeaders": [
            "Authorization"
         ],
         "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET"
         ],
         "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
         ],
         "ExposeHeaders": []
      }
   ]
   ```   
   Still on the Permissions tab, find Bucket policy, click on Edit, and then go to Policy Generator. 
   - Select Type of Policy: choose S3 Bucket Policy   
   - Effect: choose Allow   
   - Principal: *   
   - Actions: select GetObject   
   - Fill in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), from the Bucket ARN back in the Bucket Policy   
   - Click on the Add Statement and then Generate Policy. Copy the policy and paste in the bucket policy editor.  
   - Add a slash star on to the end of the resource key (because we want to allow access to all resources in this bucket). Click Save.
      The resource key should look like this
      ```  
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*",  
      ```  

   Still on Permissions tab, go to Access Control List (ACL) section, click Edit and enable List for Everyone (public access), and accept the warning box.  

5. With the bucket ready, now we need to create a user to access it through another service called IAM which stands for Identity and Access Management. Go back to the service menu and open IAM.   
   a. Create a group for our user to live in.  
      Click User Groups, and then create a new group with a name you want. I gave the group the name: manage-footwear-fusion. Scroll down to the bottom and click on Create Group.     
   b. Create an access policy giving the group access to the S3 bucket that has been created.  
      - Click on Policy, and then Create Policy. Go to the JSON tab, and then select import managed policy, which will let us import one that AWS has pre-built for full access to S3. Search for S3, then import the AmazonS3FullAccess policy.   
      - Because we only want to allow full access to our new bucket and everything within it, paste the bucket ARN (from the bucket policy page in s3) in the JSON editor.
      ```
      "Resource": [
         "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME",
         "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"
      ]
      ```  
      Now click on Next:Tags, then click Next:Review. 
      - Give the review policy a name and a description, then click Create Policy. The policy has now been created. 

   c. Finally, assign the user to the group so it can use the policy to access all our files.  
      - Go to User Groups, and select the group. Go to the Permissions tab, open the Add Permissions dropdown, and click Attach Policies.  
      - Select the policy and click Add permissions at the bottom.  
      - Create a user to put in the group, by going to the Users page, and clicking Add Users.  
      - Set a user name, give them access type: Programmatic access, and then click Next: Permissions.   
      - Check on the group that has the policy attached. Click Next: Tags, then click Next: Review, and lastly Create User.     
      - Download the csv file and save it.  

<br/>  

### **D. Connect Django to AWS Bucket**   
Note: If you've forked the repository, all of these steps are already done/ written on the files. Make sure you've installed all dependencies in the requirements.txt file, add all the AWS-related Config Vars to Heroku, and remove the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable from Heroku.   
Here are the steps I took to connect Django to AWS:  

1. Install two new packages: boto3 and django-storages. Freeze them into requirements.txt.   
   ```
   pip3 install boto3
   pip3 install django-storages 
   pip3 freeze > requirements.txt  
   ```  
2. Add storages to the Installed Apps in settings.py.
3. In settings.py, we need to set cache control, set bucket configurations, set static and media files location, and override static and media URLs in production. We'll only want to do this on Heroku, so add an if statement as well.
   ```
   if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
       # Cache control
      AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
         'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
         'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
      }

      # Bucket Config
      AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'YOUR_BUCKET_NAME'
      AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'YOUR_REGION'
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
      AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

      # Static and media files
      STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
      STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
      DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
      MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media' 
      # Override static and media URLs in production
      STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
      MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
   ```
   Set the Config Vars on Heroku. On your app's dashboard on Heroku, go to Settings and click Reveal Convig Vars. Set this variables:
   Variables | Value
   --- | ---
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | your access key id from the csv file that you've downloaded before
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | your secret access key from the csv file that you've downloaded before
   USE_AWS | True    

   Also remove the COLLECTSTATIC variable from the Config Vars.   

4. We then want to tell Django that in production we want to use S3 to store our static files whenever someone runs collectstatic, and that we sent any uploaded images to go there as well.  
Create a custom_storages.py file in your project's root directory, and inside it, include the Static and Media Storage locations: 
   ```
   from django.conf import settings
   from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage
 
   class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
      location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION
   class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
      location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
   ```  
5. Finally, push these changes on Github.

   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push
   ```

### **A. Code**
- The Boutique Ado project featured in the Code Institute's video served as the primary reference for establishing an e-commerce/online store project. This setup utilized a range of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python with Django, PostgreSQL for database management, Stripe for payment processing, and AWS S3 for storage solutions.

- The tutorial by Patrick Loeber provided an invaluable resource for learning how to debug code using breakpoints, which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZJnGOwzHtU.

- The star rating system implemented on the Add Review and Edit Review pages is inspired by a method detailed in this [article](https://codeconvey.com/feedback-form-in-html/). This approach transforms radio button input elements into a 1 to 5 star rating system.
