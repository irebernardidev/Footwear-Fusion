### **3. Structure Plane**  
The website features a Hierarchical Tree Structure, meticulously organized to facilitate easy and intuitive navigation for users. Illustrated below is the website's workflow, thoughtfully crafted using [Creately](https://creately.com/).  

![The website's structure](readme-testing-files/readme/structure.png "The website's structure")   
The design distinctly differentiates the access levels between unregistered and registered users. While unregistered users have the capability to purchase products and receive confirmation emails, they lack certain privileges exclusive to registered users, including:

- Accessing their order history
- Posting, editing, and deleting product reviews
- Creating a personalized list of favorite products.

All the aforementioned functionalities are accessible only to users with a registered account.

<br/>  

### **4. Skeleton Plane**  
Using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), wireframes were developed to outline the website's navigation and interface. These wireframes, specifically designed for desktop viewing, form the foundation upon which the interface will be adapted for various device sizes.

<br/>

#### **Color Scheme**  
The website's design language is articulated through a color palette that captures the essence of tranquility and natural beauty. Each hue is carefully chosen to create an ambiance that is both calming and welcoming, with a subtle infusion of warmth that conjures a sense of peace and serenity.
At the heart of the palette featured on [Coolors](https://coolors.co)is a soft blush pink (#F5CAC3), radiating a gentle and hospitable vibe. It's paired with an effervescent coral (#F28482), which injects the layout with a lively yet cozy warmth, resonating with a cheerful and dynamic spirit. Grounding these effusive tones, the muted teal (#84A59D) lends an earthy depth to the aesthetic, echoing the brand's connection to natural elements and understated elegance.

The selection of these colors transcends mere visual pleasure; it is a deliberate strategy to elicit a psychological sense of ease and contentment among visitors. This chromatic harmony is woven consistently throughout the websiteâ€™s interface, from the tactile feedback of interactive elements to the enchanting allure of the hero image. Each detail is steeped in these colors, crafting a cohesive and engaging digital narrative that guides the user through an effortlessly integrated visual experience.
![The color scheme](readme-testing-files/readme/color-scheme.png "The color scheme")

#### **Typography**  
The typographic elements of the website are curated from the extensive collection available at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).   
- Primary Typeface: Noto Sans
  Serving as the primary typeface, Noto Sans is a sans-serif font favored for its contemporary and sleek aesthetic. It is employed across the board for paragraphs and button labels, offering a crisp and uncluttered look.
- Accent Typeface: DM Serif Display
  For a striking contrast, DM Serif Display is utilized for header texts on the Home page. As a serif font, it provides an elegant counterpoint to the sans-serif body text, adding a touch of sophistication and visual interest.

#### **Design Changes on The Final Product**  
The original wireframes were foundational in shaping the final design, however, adjustments were made to ensure optimal functionality and aesthetics:

- The logo underwent a transformation to a bolder version for enhanced visibility, addressing the issue that the initial, finer logo was not as prominent on smaller screens.
- Additional refinements included alterations in button colors and image selections, which were part of the creative evolution during the development process.

## **Database Design**    

The database structure was conceptualized and outlined using [drawsql](https://drawsql.app/), starting with SQLite for the development phase and transitioning to Postgres for the production environment on Heroku. 
![The database schema](readme-testing-files/readme/database-schema.png " The database schema")  

- **Category Model**   
   - This model holds the category names for products, such as Women, Men, and Kids.
   - It includes a 'name' field for database identification and a 'friendly_name' field for the user interface display.

- **Subcategory Model**
   - This captures the subcategory names for products, which range from Sandals to New Arrivals.
   - The Category and Subcategory models are designed to be independent; no direct relationship is established to allow for greater flexibility.
   - Similar to the Category model, it has 'name' and 'friendly_name' fields for database and display purposes, respectively.  

- **Product Model**  
   - This model is a repository of comprehensive product details.
   - It is linked to the Category and Subcategory models through foreign keys.
   - Includes fields such as 'sku' for product identification, 'name', 'has_sizes' as a boolean to indicate if size variations exist, 'price', and 'rating'. 
   - The 'rating' initially reflects a retailer-provided quality assessment, which is updated as users review the product.
   - 'image' field for product visuals, and 'total_purchased' to track sales volume.

- **User M odel**  
   - Integral to the Django authentication system, this model stores user credentials, including username, email, and password.[django.contrib.auth](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/contrib/auth/).

   - It includes a 'product_size', 'quantity', and 'lineitem_total', which is the product of quantity and price.

   - It is linked to the User model and contains fields like 'default_phone_number', 'default_country', etc.

   - Includes a 'rating', 'review_text', and 'date' among other fields.

- **Favorites Model**  
   - Keeps track of a user's favorite products.
   - To handle the many-to-many relationship with products, an intermediary model called 'FavoritesItem' is used, aligning with best practices from the Django documentation.([source from django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ManyToManyField.through_fields)).

- **Topic Model**
  - This model manages topics for the contact form.
  - It has a 'subject' field for database entries and a 'text' field for the display on the contact form.

- **ContactForm Model**
  - Stores submissions from the contact form.
  - Includes 'name', 'email', 'topic' (linked to the Topic model), 'order_number', 'message', and 'date' fields.

Each model is crafted to not only store essential data but also to create a seamless interaction between different segments of the site, ensuring data integrity and user experience are maintained at the highest standard.

## **Features**  
### **A. General Design Features**  
- **Responsive Design:** The website adapts seamlessly to all devices, ensuring a consistent user experience from the smallest smartphone (minimum width 320px) to the largest desktop display. Navigation is made effortless with intuitive buttons, accessible at any point during the user's journey through the site. 

- **Navigation Bar Across All Pages:**
   ![The Navbar on desktop](readme-testing-files/readme/navbar-desktop.png "The Navbar on desktop")   

   - The Navbar is designed for flexibility, transforming into a hamburger menu on smaller screens for ease of use, and remains fixed at the top of the screen (sticky) for convenient navigation regardless of the user's position on the page.
   - Symmetrically centered at the top, the logo acts as a beacon, always ready to guide users back to the homepage.
   - The search box is strategically placed on the left within the Navbar to facilitate quick keyword searches from the outset.
   - Sign In/Register buttons are prominently located at the top-right corner for unregistered users, unfolding options for either action. This area transforms into a My Account dropdown upon logging in, offering direct links to the user's profile and log-out function.
   - Quick-access links to Favorites and Shopping Bag are embedded within the Navbar, ensuring they're always within reach, no matter where users find themselves on the site.
   - Navigation links are provided for all product categories and subcategories: All Products, Women, Men, Kids, Accessories, and Sale.
   - A persistent sales banner positioned just below the Navbar alerts users to free delivery options, visible on every page for constant visibility.

- **Footer Accessible on All Pages:** 
   ![The Footer on desktop](readme-testing-files/readme/footer-desktop.png "The Footer on desktop") 
   The Footer mirrors the Navbar's color scheme for design continuity and houses all navigational links, social media connections (which open in a new tab), and the central logo that circles back to the Home page when clicked. 

- **Toast Notifications:**   
Toast notifications serve as an interactive feedback mechanism for users, confirming the success or alerting to the failure of their actions. These notifications are color-coded for clarity: red signifies errors, blue for informational alerts, yellow for warnings, and green indicates successful actions. Typically, users will encounter the green success toasts most frequently, such as when adding items to the shopping bag, complemented by a visual cue of the bag itself. For other successful actions like adding items to the favorites list, a success toast appears sans the bag icon. Here are examples of the success toast notifications, with and without the bag icon display.
